# Features and Usage:

File:
- Open (Ctrl+O) : Select any NFS Language Binary File (.bin) to edit it using Labrune.
- Import : You can import string data from various sources. They are described below.
    - Text File : Import string data from a text file exported using Labrune. It's applied to all language chunks, if the file contains multiple.
    - Ed Config Folder : Select your Ed Configurations (Ed\Config\GAME) folder to import string data. It's applied to currently selected language chunk.
    - ReCompiler Language Folder (New) : Select your ReCompiler Language (ReCompiler\LANGUAGE) folder to import all the .ini files that contains string data. It's applied to currently selected language chunk.
    - ReCompiler Config.ini (Old) : Select your ReCompiler/Texture Compiler Language (Texture Compiler\LANGUAGE\Add\Config.ini) file to import all the string data in it. It's applied to currently selected language chunk.
    - LangEd Dump: Import string data from a text file exported using NFS-LangEd. It's applied to currently selected language chunk.
- Export: You can export string data from currently opened language file to edit it externally.
    - Text File : Export string data from currently opened language file. It exports all the data in all language chunks, if the file contains multiple.
- Save (Ctrl+S) : Saves the language file and labels file (optionally) you worked on.
- Exit (Alt+F4) : Closes the program. If there are any changes made, it prompts you to save the file before closing.

Edit:
- Add (Alt+A) : It opens a new window for you to add a new string entry. Fields in the window are described below.
    - Hash: A 4-byte number used by the game to access the specified string. It's filled automatically as you write the label, unless you've checked Use Custom Hash option, which allows you to edit the Hash manually.
    - Label: A name for the string, which gets hashed to a 4-byte number by the game to access the specified string. The hash gets updated as you write your label here. It's frozen if you've checked Use Custom Hash option, which allows you to edit the Hash manually.
    - Big text box: That's where you should enter your string as you want to see it in the game.
- Edit (Alt+E) : It opens a new window for you to edit the string you have selected from the list. Fields from Add option are also valid for this one. Alternatively, you can double-click the string you want to edit.
- Remove (Alt+R) : It removes the string you have selected from the list.
- Find (Ctrl+F) : It lets you find strings with specified text data, or hashes and labels.
    - Value to find: The text you want to find in strings.
    - Case sensitive: If you check this, it will only find the results in the case exactly as you write. (It won't find "tReE" if you wrote "Tree".)
    - Find also in hashes and labels: If you check this, hashes and labels are also included into the search.
- Find Previous (F3) : Goes to the next find result in backwards. Wraps around if you are at the first result.
- Find Next (F6) : Goes to the next find result. Wraps around if you are at the last result.
- Go to Previous Modified (F4) : Goes to the next modified string in backwards. Wraps around if you are at the first one.
- Go to Next Modified (F7) : Goes to the next modified string. Wraps around if you are at the last one.
- Font Settings (Alt+F) : Opens font settings window. It's applied to the string view on main screen.
- Options (Alt+O) : Opens a window to change some settings for Labrune. They are listed below.
    - Also save Labels file while saving: If checked, labels will also be saved into their specific file when you are saving your language file. It's useful if you keep editing language files with new stuff.
    - Create Backups: If checked, Labrune will create a backup of the file you worked on, with a time stamp. (For example: English_Global.bin.20191105141233.labrunebackup)
